Evaluate Java development skills in 4 steps.


Steps
-----
* Implement ```q1.Step1``` in ```response.Step1Impl``` skeleton.
* Implement ```q2.Step2``` in ```response.Step2Impl``` skeleton.
* Implement ```q3.Step3``` in ```response.Step3Impl``` skeleton.
* Implement ```q4.Step4``` in ```response.Step4Impl``` skeleton.

Before starting
---------------
* Read carefully indications given in interfaces javadoc.
* Existing code modification is not allowed.
* All code should be written in response package.
* Additional classes can be created in response package.
* Run ```Main``` to perform a quick test of 4 implementations (and debug).
